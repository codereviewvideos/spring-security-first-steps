This is the code example for the full
post [here](https://codereviewvideos.com/first-steps-with-spring-security-amp-rest-api/).

In this post, we explore how to implement basic login functionality in a Spring Boot REST API, focusing on Spring
Security.

We start by creating simple endpoints, then gradually integrate Spring Security to restrict access to specific routes.

You'll also learn how to test these endpoints using @WithMockUser for automated tests.

It's a hands-on guide aimed at beginners, walking through project setup, configuration, and testing.
